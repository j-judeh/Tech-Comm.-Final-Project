	<div class="important"><h1 id="indx" >FIGHT BACK AGAINST PARKING TICKETS</h1></div>
	<p>Here at tothestreets.com, we are advocating for motorists to challenge tickets they may be wrongfully charged for. We are centralized in Ward 3 and have a plethora of resources to convince motorists to challenge these violations.</p>
	<h2>Ward 3 ProPublica Statistics</h2>
	<p>Citizens of Chicago should <strong>not</strong> be afraid to contest their tickets. Due to the data provided by <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/chicago-tickets/">ProPublica.org's Chicago Ticket Trap Database</a> Out of 1 million cases, 64% tickets that were contested won, despite only 12%(84,910) of issued tickets being contested. This graph below demonstrates the different statuses tickets are in queue.</p>
	<div class="important"><a href="https://projects.propublica.org/chicago-tickets/"><img src="data_tickets.png" height="400px" width="500px" alt="Graph on Tickets challenged, paid, or dismissed."></a>
	 <ul>
  	<li>Bankruptcy:  if the ticket was unpaid and included as a debt in a consumer bankruptcy case</li>
  	<li>Define: if the city cannot identify the vehicle owner and collect on a debt. Current as of May 14, 2018, when the data was last updated</li>
  	<li>Dismissed: if the ticket was dismissed, (either internally or as a result of an appeal)</li>
  	<li>Notice: if the ticket was not yet paid and the city sent a notice to the address on file for that vehicle</li>
  	<li>Paid: if the ticket was paid</li>
  	<li>Court: if the ticket is involved in some sort of court case, not including bankruptcy</li>
  	<li>Hearing Request: if the ticket was contested and awaiting a hearing at the time the data was pulled</li>
	</ul> </div> 
	<h2>A deeper look</h2>
	<p>A highlight from their csv dataset also states that the top 5 violations in Ward 3 were <strong>not</strong> paid, as 1 violation was successfully dismissed as not liable, 2 could not be identified, and 2 were issued notices that have not been tended. With a 64% success rate of contesting tickets, you and other Chicago motorists should be contesting their tickets today!
