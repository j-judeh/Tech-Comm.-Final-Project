	<h1 id="indx" >FIGHT BACK AGAINST PARKING TICKETS</h1>
	<p>Here at tothestreets.com, we are advocating for motorists to challenge tickets they may be wrongfully charged for. We are centralized in Ward 3 and have a plethora of resources to convince motorists to challenge these violations.</p>
	<p>Citizens of Chicago should <strong>not</strong> be afraid to contest their tickets. Due to the data provided by <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/chicago-tickets/">ProPublica.org's Chicago Ticket Trap Database</a> 64% tickets that were contested won, despite only 12% of issued tickets being contested.</p>
	<p>A highlight from their csv dataset also states that the top 5 violations in Ward 3 were <strong>not</strong> paid, as 1 violation was successfully dismissed as not liable, 2 could not be identified, and 2 were issued notices that have not been tended. With a 64% success rate of contesting tickets, you and other Chicago motorists should be contesting their tickets today! Please see our <a href="">Argument Template</a> for more details!</p>
