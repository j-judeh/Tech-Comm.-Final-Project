This is a template file in order to help add additonal webpages.

Titles
	Only the title of the webpage should use "<h1>" tags, every other heading 
	should be smaller

	Secondary headings should cover specific ideas within the main title and
	use "<h2>" tags; secondary headings cover more specific areas of the title

	Tertiary headings should use "<h>" tags and should cover more specific areas 
	of the secondary headings

	EXAMPLE:
	TITLE: Food
	SECONDARY HEADING: Fruit
	TERTIARY HEAdING: Apples

Text
	 Most text should be formatted with the "<p>"
	 
	 Use "<b>" on titles within "<ol>"/"<ul>" in order to emphasize them
	 
	 Keep in mind using "<i>" on smaller texts presents an accessibility issue
	 
	 "<b class="blue">" should be used on VERY important information like
	 the names of policies or programs
	 
	 links should be labeled clearly to where they will send users
	 
Asides and Images
	the " alt=' ' " section within the "<img>" tag should be a shortened form of 
	the file name
	
	contain all images within "<figure>" tags to allow for "<figcaption>" tags
	which allow for captioning images
	
	"<aside>" should be used on helpful advice or very important oinformation 
	that is relatively shorter than the other texts. It should be something
	you want to guarentee the viewer sees.
	
Try to avoid: quaternary headings, over using headings, overusing "<p>",
			  large walls of text, similar font colors to the background,
			  very bright colors, very small text, unbalanced text structures,
			  etc...etc...
